A religious organization that preaches strict adherence to [[Accena]] oral lore though it's interpretation of the tenets of [[Accena]] are very specific and border on mysticism. 

This sect of [[Accenalore]] ignores most of [[Accena]], acknowledging most of it only as a means of not stirring the socio-political pot. They fixate on and regard exclusively The Ninth History, also known as the **Long Nights**. 

The Long Nights is 10 stories about the trials of a Sorcerer named Griefe. For 10 nights he is tested by 10 great evils, each night prevailing and learning a great lesson about the nature of humanity until the last night. After having learned everything that humanity is capable of, he gives up having lost his faith in his own humanity.

This sect is quite secretive about it's inner workings. All that is generally know about its structure is that it is divided into 10 orders that full members may be inducted into. They also have a presence in most cities on the continent although it's anybody's guess whether and how they wield any political influence they hold.

"*Humanity is weakness. Humanity is strength.*"
