A religious organization that is moderate in its observance of [[Accena]] oral lore. 

This sect of [[Accenalore]] operates all over the continent with a major presence in most cities. It is one of the newest [[Accenalore]] sects, as it rose to relative prominence the late in the Third War Era. 

Rodaulism was founded as and is considered a more moderate and palatable alterative to Accenatarianism. Its core membership consists mostly of people ostracized by the more fundamental sects but who still want to the same core ideas as Accenatarianism.

This is the only major sect that seems to have been born as a reaction to an existing sect. This is not to say that some other sects are not reactionary but it is the only existing sect to have been born from this reaction.
