A religious organization that derives it's core tenets from [[Accena]] oral lore. 

This sect of [[Accenalore]] bases it's beliefs mostly on The Tenth History which is more commonly referred to as the Passion. This is where the name *Passists* comes from.

Passists more or less believe in the overall importance of the entire [[Accena]] as a series of lessons about the world and humanity and about that which humanity shares this continent with, but find the greatest lesson of the [[Accena]] to be found in The Passion.

The Passion is one of only two [[Accena]] histories to only have one story (the other being The Last History). This story is called "Liida and Herihn". It is a story about a love between a human named Liida and a Mythin named Herihn. The Passists believe that the lesson of this story is that humanity can only ever find it's purpose in love and that without love, life is meaningless. 

To be clear, Passists do not have any strong opinions regarding lust or sex in general. In the eyes of a Passist, a love is measured in its quality not it's quantity or means of expression.

The Passists are a community based sect. You will find them in any community, city, or town but they have no greater apparatus with which to wield political or financial power. The connection between groups of Passists is purely one of common belief.
