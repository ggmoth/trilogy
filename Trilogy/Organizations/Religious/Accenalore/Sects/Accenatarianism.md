A religious organization that preaches strict adherence to [[Accena]] oral lore. 

This sect of [[Accenalore]] operates all over the continent with a major presence in most cities as well as a network of information gatherers spread throughout the continent. In the Current Era, their seat of power is the [[Central Accenatarian Cathedral]]. 

This sect is known for having the oldest presence on the continent. The Accenatarian church uses it's deep roots and history along with it's expansive information network to wield enormous political power, entrenching itself in the political systems of each city and alliance it has a presence in.

The beliefs of Accenatarianism can best be described as a belief that [[Accena]] calls for a heavily hierarchical system where everyone's purpose is absolute. They believe all should live to serve the needs and goals of the church and that if everyone did this then the church would be able to create true happiness. They believe that [[Accena]] is essentially a guide to how to pass the test of existence, that the continent will see another rebirth as it did at [[Beginning]] and it is not until humanity can achieve continental happiness, that the rebirths will end, humanity having passed the test being able to move on to glory.

While this is the belief system of the sect, there is a firm divide between those seeking the goal of continental happiness as a means of reaching glory and those who are within the church to use the political power it possesses.
