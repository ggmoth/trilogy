A religious organization that preaches strict adherence to a person code derived from the eight legends found in the Thirteenth History in [[Accena]] oral lore. 

This sect of [[Accenalore]] has no formal structure beyond Priests and Vicars. There exist only 8 Dictive Priests and at most 8 Vicars at any given time. A Dictive Priest will take on a student as a Vicar and train them until the Priest dies and the Vicar takes their mantle and subsequently takes on a new Vicar.

Each of these 8 Priests bares the name of one of the Legendary figures within the Thirteenth History.

Virtually nothing is known about this sect beyond it's existence and its Priest/Vicar structure. It's goals are known only to the Priests if it has any.
