**Origin and Practice**
The oral lore of the continent purportedly passed down from [[Beginning]]. It's origins are not known for certain but the [[Accenalore]] faiths consider it a founding document and their primary religious text. It is often referred to as a text though it is an *oral* lore.

Accena is, put most simply, the oral history of the [[Primordial Era]], an era of legends and myths of a time before humanity was the predominant force on the continent.

**Organization**
Accena is broken up into *histories* and *stories*. There are 14 histories with varying amounts of stories in each history.

These histories are:
	- The First History (2 stories)

**Secular Importance**
Though there are many who do not practice an [[Accenalore]] faith, Accena is none the less the origin for much of the way in which humanity talks about and frames the history of the continent.

This oral history is the origin of the terms [[Beginning]] and [[Primordial Era]] as they refer to the two [[eras]] of unrecorded time. Many of it's stories and lessons are the defacto basis for norms and common practices of the current era. Even the way in which time is recorded and broken up into [[eras]] can be attributed to Accena. It can not be understated the influence that Accena has on the continent even for non-practitioners.
