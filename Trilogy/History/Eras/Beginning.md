**First History**, *The Story of Janisha*
> Janisha woke to a beginning and saw that they had been born of the primordial forces and that they understood the primordial forces. Janisha closed their eyes and when they opened again a word came out of the primordial just as Janisha had and the word was ***create***. And so humanity was born and immediately gifted by the continent the first magic.
> *This is the story of Janisha, the Birth of Humanity* 

Nobody knows if there was anything before this beginning but **[[Accena]]** is clear to state that it was *a* beginning.

[[Accenatarianism]] holds that this beginning was one of many rebirths of the world in accordance with their belief that the continent renews itself as a test of humanity.
