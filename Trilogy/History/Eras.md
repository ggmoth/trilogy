In [[Accena]]'s third history, in the story of Fadild, the lesson is that time should be counted as to understand the patterns of time so that generations may benefit and learn the lessons of their ancestors. The lesson posits that the reason the heroes of the [[Primordial Era]] fell in and out of war, finding glory in equal parts with suffering was the lack of respect for the lessons of the past.

This story is the foundation for the practice and use of the era calendar. This calendar breaks the past and the present into 100ish year chunks of time and gives them names to describe them. These names are not always the most accurate but seek to capture the core lesson of the 100 year span of time. This task of naming is usually done by what ever the prevailing sect of the [[Accenalore]] faith is at the time.

These are the recorded eras:
	- [[Beginning]] (unknown)
	- The [[Primordial Era]] (unknown)
	- The [[First Magical Era]] (100 years)
	- The [[First War Era]] (103 years)
	- The [[Second War Era]] (98 years)
	- The [[First Era of Peace (Last Era of Peace)]] (92 years)
	- The [[First Information Era]] (109 years)
	- The [[Second Magical Era]] (101 years)
	- The [[Third War Era]] (99 years)
	- The [[Current Era]] (7 years)
